Developer: 

            The developer is the employee that will submit and write software packages and submit project requests. They will use open
            source software to create these software packages and project packages. Regarding the software packages, they will compare
            the software packages with known vulnerabilities and the software will be scanned for licenses to make sure they are abiding
            with the the legal use of the open source software. The developer will compare known vulnerablities in the software to
            policies set by the manager and organization to be acceptable for the corporation's needs.

Manager:

            The manager can request software projects to be completed. The manager will compare sofware project license and
            vulnerability information with the corporation's poliicies for acceptable standards regarding known vulnerabilities.
            The manager is able to request policy information and also modify and add new policies to meet the corporation's standards.
            
Scanner:

            The scanner is the process of testing the open source software for licenses associated with the use of the software. The 
            developer must follow the correct procedures for licensing the software in order to abide to the legal use of the software.

Manage Software Package for License Scanning and Vulnerabilities:

            The process that will take software packages from the developer and manage the packages to test for known vulnerabilities
            and send the software package to the scanner process to check for licenses. The information the process gets returned will
            be sent back to the developer and also to a datastore. 

Software Package:

            The software package is a collection of files the developer will use to complete the objective of the software project
            request. The software package will be scanned for licenses and known vulnerabilities, that information will then be sent
            back to the developer and to a data store to be set against software projects. 

Software Package Name:

            The name of the software package will be sent to the vulnerability database to be tested for known vulnerabilties.

Software Package License Results:

            The results of the software package being sent to the scanner, testing for licenses associated with the software package
            being used. These license results will be stored with vulnerability information in a datastore and will also be sent back to             the developer. 

Software Package Vulnerablities:

            The known vulnerabilities stored in the NIST Vulnerability Datastore from the software package submitted will be sent to
            the process of managing software license and vulnerabilities. The developer will then be able to access the results and
            the results will also be stored in a datastore with the license information to be used for software projects.

Software Package License and Vulnerabilitiy Results: 

            This is the datastore that will have the license results and known vulnerabilities for software packages the developer will
            use to complete their software project. The project's requested will be set against this datastore, by the manager and                   developer, to verify the license and vulnerability information meet the coporation's policy.

NIST Vulnerability Database:

            This datastore will have known vulnerability information based off specific open source software packages. The developer
            will submit their software packages to this database and the results will be stored for use by the manager and devloper
            to compare to the corporation's policy for acceptable thresholds regarding known vulnerabilities with the software packages.

Software Package and License Vulnerability Information:

            This datastore will have information on licenses and known vulnerabilities regarding open source software packages. This 
            datastore will be used to set software being used for projects against the corporation's policies regarding the known
            vulnerabilities and the proper licensing for the use of the software packages. The developer and manager will both be able
            to access information in this datastore.

Software Project Request:

            The manager or developer can submit project requests to meet the corporation's new goals or enhance current practices.
            The software projects will be made up of software packages that the developer will get from open sources. 

Accept and Verify Project Request:

            This is the process that will compare the software project's software against known vulnerabilities and licenses associated
            with software packages in the software project. The manager or developer will be able to view the results of this process.

Software Project License and Vulnerability Information:

            This is the information that will be sent back to the accept and verify project request that was submitted by the developer
            or manager. This is information about licenses and known vulnerbalities associated with software packages in the software 
            project. The manager will use this information to compare it to the corporation's policies to make sure it meets the
            requirements. The developper will use this information to change or update the software packages in the software project
            to make sure it is licensed correctly and meets acceptable thresholds for known vulnerbalities.

Get Policy:

            This is the process the developer or manager will go through to get policies the corporation sets to meet acceptable
            vulnerability thresholds. 

Policy/Policy Information:

            The corporation will set standards in their policy regarding acceptable vulnerability thresholds and licenses required for
            legal use of the software projects. The manager or developer can request to view policies to make sure the software
            project meets policy requirements.

Manage Policies:

            This process will be used by the manager to update or add new policies to the corporation's policy database. The corporation
            will add or change there policies based off new vulnerabilities that are exposed or if the developer needs to add to the
            lincenses associated with the software packages in the software project.      

Policy Request:

            The manager or developer can request to view policies to verify the software project meets policy requirements.

Policy Database:

            This datastore will have all of the policies the corporation creates to set standards for acceptable vulnerability 
            thresholds and license requirements. The manager will be the one to add or update policies in the datastore. The developer
            will be able to access this database along with the manager to be able to view policies set by the corporation through
            the get policy process.
