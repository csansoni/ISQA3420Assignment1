Developer: 

            The developer is the employee that will submit and write software packages and submit project requests. They will use open
            source software to create these software packages and project packages. Regarding the software packages, they will compare
            the software packages with known vulnerabilities and the software will be scanned for licenses to make sure they are abiding
            with the the legal use of the open source software. The developer will compare known vulnerablities in the software to
            policies set by the manager and organization to be acceptable for the organizations needs.

Manager:

            The manager can request software projects to be completed. The manager wil compare sofware project license and
            vulnerability information with the corporation's poliicies for acceptable standards regarding known vulnerabilities.
            The manager is able to request policy information and also modify and add new policies to meet the corporation's standards.
            
Scanner:

            The scanner is the process of testing the open source software for licenses associated with the use of the software. The 
            developer must follow the correct procedures for licensing the software in order to abide to the legal use of the software.

Manage Software Package for License Scanning and Vulnerabilities:

            The process that will take software packages from the developer and manage the packages to test for known vulnerabilities
            and send the software package to the scanner process to check for licenses. The information the process gets returned will
            be sent back to the developer and also to a datastore. 

Software Package:

            The software package is a collection of files the developer will use to complete the objective of the software project
            request. The software package will be scanned for licenses and known vulnerabilities, that information will then be sent
            back to the developer and to a data store to be set against software projects. 

Software Package Name:

            The name of the software package will be sent to the vulnerability database to be tested for known vulnerabilties.

Software Package License Results:

            The results of the software package being sent to the scanner, testing for licenses associated with the software package
            being used. These license results will be stored with vulnerability information in a datastore and will also be sent back to             the developer.
