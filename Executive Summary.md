Executive Summary:

              The purpose of this newly designed system is to test new software projects against acceptable vulnerability thresholds
              and licenses associated with the software packages used in the projects against corporate policy. A developer or manager
              will submit a project request and the developer will use open source software packages and files to accomplish the 
              software project needs. The software project will then be tested for vulnerabilities and licenses associated with the 
              software packages. The vulnerabilities and licenses will be set against corporate policy that the manager will create
              or update if requested by the corporation.
