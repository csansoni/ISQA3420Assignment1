Executive Summary:

              The purpose of this newly designed system is to test new software projects against acceptable vulnerability thresholds
              and licenses associated with the software packages used in the projects against corporate policy. A developer or manager
              will submit a project request and the developer will use open source software packages and files to accomplish the 
              software project needs. The software project will then be tested for vulnerabilities and licenses associated with the 
              software packages. The vulnerabilities and licenses will be set against corporate policy that the manager will create
              or update if requested by the corporation.
              
              The developer or manager will both now be able to submit requests for new software projects. The developer can now use
              open source software to meet the goals of the corporation. The developer will colaborate with open source communities
              like those of MIT and Apache as long as the developer gets permission from those communities and incorporates the correct
              licenses in the software project. The developer and manager now have the authority and control to test the software projects
              against known vulnerabilities and to test the projects to see if it violates any license terms.
